"""
Longest Increasing/Decreasing Subsequence via Dynamic Programming

We scan forward through each position `i` in the input permutation `pi`.
At each `i`, we look back at all earlier positions `j < i` and see whether we can
extend the best subsequence ending at `j` by adding `pi[i]`.

- We maintain `L_inc[i]`: length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at `i`.
- We maintain `P_inc[i]`: pointer to the previous index in that subsequence.

Specifically, for each `i`:
    for each `j < i`:
        if `pi[j] < pi[i]` and `L_inc[j] + 1 > L_inc[i]`:
            update `L_inc[i] = L_inc[j] + 1`
            record `P_inc[i] = j`

This reuses previously computed `L_inc[j]` values (never recomputing them)â€”
the hallmark of dynamic programming.  Once the tables are built, we find the
maximum `L_inc[i]`, backtrack via `P_inc` to reconstruct the actual subsequence,
and do the same for the decreasing case.
